WNXplorer is a WordNet visualization software with a graph-based navigation.

The *dict* sub-directory of WordNet is needed. You can download WordNet here: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/.
Choose the tarball under the section "WordNet 3.0 for UNIX-like systems (including: Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris)" even if you are using MS-Windows.

Feel free to send me an email at [mailto:nicolas.james@gmail.com] if you are interested by this application or if you encounter a problem.

The goal of the project is to provide:
  * an easy-to-use and extendable graph-based WordNet visualization application,
  * the implementation of several concept similarity measures,
  * a procedure for easily extract a subgraph of the WordNet graph.
