	<h2>First start</h2>

	<p>
		The first time you launch WNXplorer, the application ask to you to
		indicate the location of the <b>dict</b> folder of a WordNet
		distribution. If you want to modify this location after the first
		launch of the application, you can directly modify the <b>WNXplorer.properties</b>
		file and update the value of the key <b>PROPERTY_WORDNET_PATH</b>.
	</p>

	<h2>Search</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Make a search in the <b>Search</b> view. A left-click on a
			result (i.e. a SynSet) adds a node for this result on the graph view.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The graph view</h2>
	<ul>

		<li>There are two modes for interacting with the graph view. The
			modes are exclusive:
			<ul>
				<li>Pan mode: to translate de view</li>
				<li>Picking mode: to pick and move nodes. Use the <b>p</b> key
					you enter/leave the picking mode</li>
			</ul> You can always pan the view by using the middle mouse button and a
			click &amp; drag.</li>

		<li>Zoom operations: use the wheel mouse.</li>

		<li>Nodes in the graph have 2 states:
			<ul>
				<li><b>selected</b>: only one node at a time can be in the <i>selected</i>
					state. You can set the selected node by a left-click over a node
					when the graph view is in the pan mode. The selected node is
					described in the <i>Description View</i>. A selected node appears
					with a bold shape like in the following screenshot:<br/>
					<div class="center"><img src="./help_illustration_1.png" /></div></li>
					
				<li><b>picked</b>: a picked node can be move. To pick a node
					you can make a left-click over a node when the graph view is set in
					the Picking mode. You can move several nodes at the same time by
					setting the picked state on several nodes, to doing this: use the
					SHIFT+left click to pick each node. A picked node is filled in
					Yellow like in the following screenshot:<br />
					<div class="center"><img src="./help_illustration_2.png" /></div></li>
				
			</ul> Note that the two states are not exclusive, a node can be selected
			an picked.</li>

		<li>each node has a contextual menu that appears with a right
			click over it.</li>

		<li>to develop a node (i.e. add to the graph all its parent nodes
			directly accessible): (1) left double-click over a node, or (2) use
			the right mouse button on a node to make appear the contextual menu
			and click the option "Develop".</li>

		<li>Clear the graph: CTRL-C</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>CTRL-c</b>: clear the graph view.</li>
		<li><b>p</b> (when the graph view has the focus): entering/leaving the picking mode.</li>
		<li><b>F11</b>: entering/leaving the fullscreen mode.</li>
	</ul>
